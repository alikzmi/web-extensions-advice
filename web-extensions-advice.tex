\section*{Best Web Browsers for Privacy}
\section*{Desktop}
\subsubsection*{Firefox}
\paragraph{}
Recommended for Privacy.
\subsubsection*{LibreWolf}
\paragraph{}
Recommended for Full Privacy. I recommend you to download the LibreWolf config files from its GitLab repository and add them to your Firefox web browser.

\section*{Android}
\subsubsection*{Bromite}
\paragraph{}
Bromite is a \emph{fast} \& \emph{lightweight browser}, based on Chromium that provides an option for changing your browser timezone. it has it's own adblocker.\\
However this adblocker doesn't block Ads like \emph{Ublock Origin} \& \emph{AdGuard Blocker}, but it is effective most of the times.

\paragraph{}
It is recommended to change your \emph{Browser User Agent} to increase your privacy.

\section*{How to Prevent DNS Hijacking}
\paragraph{}
The only thing you need to do is to change your \emph{DNS Server} and select a \emph{DNS Server} that supports one of these protocols : 
\subsubsection*{DNS over TLS (DOT)}
\subsubsection*{DNS over HTTPS (DOH)}
\subsubsection*{DNSCrypt\\}

\begin{large}
	\paragraph{}
	Most of the websites are blocked with DNS Hijacking (Also known as \emph{DNS Poisioning}) , so you can easily acces them with this method. Some countries (Iran, China , ...) block the DNS Servers that support these protocols.
\end{large}
